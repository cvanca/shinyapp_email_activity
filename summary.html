<h1>How to understand outputs and graphs</h1>
  <p>
  	Tab <b>Visualize activity rate</b> is a graphical representation of the activity of email subscribers. The <i> x </i> axis shows the level of activity, ie how customers have been involved in their entire history at Silverpop. The <i> y </i> axis shows the number of subscribers with a given activity rate. The price tag for each group of recipients expresses the cost of sending emails to everyone in the group with a given level of activity.
  </p>
  <p>
	If <b>Activity rate</b> <i>= 0</i>, it means that the recipient does not perform any activity (ie he does not even open emails).
	If <b>Activity rate</b> <i>is greater than 1</i>, the recipient performs on average more than one action per received email.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the graph you can see the <b>activity rate</b> only for values 0 to 1. For a more detailed view of more active customers (including those with an activity rate greater than 1), the complete list is shown on the next tab <b>Activity rate table</b>.
