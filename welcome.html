<h3>How to use this Shiny App?</h3>
  <p>
	First, in the panel on the right of the scale, choose how much it costs you to send thousands of emails, and then upload the export data from IBM Marketing Cloud using the <b> Choose file </b> button. The file must be in .csv format and ideally should have at least two columns:
	<ol>
	  <li><i>Recipient Id</i></li>
	  <li><i>Event Type</i></li>
	</ol>
  </p>
  <p>
	<b>Since you are not uploading email addresses anywhere, but only Recipient Id, your data cannot be leaked.</b>
  </p>
  <p>
	Then all you have to do is wait for the data to be uploaded and enjoy how much money can be saved by proper analysis and subsequent segmentation of your email subscribers.
